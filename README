Morbo is a multiboot binary intended to be loaded from Grub or a
similar multiboot-capable boot loader. It tries to find a
OHCI-compatible Firewire controller on your PCI bus and enable
physical DMA. After that it boots the first multiboot
module. Diagnostics are printed on the serial console.

If Morbo cannot find an OHCI-compliant controller, it will complain,
but continue. If it is not given a module to start, it will wait for
modules to be written using Remote DMA.

To build morbo and related tools, type:
 scons

A sample grub.conf (Grub 1) to boot morbo could look like the following:

  title Morbo
  kernel /morbo
  module /yourkernel
